## RekordBox Setup

# 1. bind cue points A - J to --> 1, 2, 3, cmd + 4, cmd + 5, cmd + 6, cmd + 7, cmd + 8, cmd + 9, cmd + -
# 2. Set RekordBox to Export Mode and 1 Player 




## Script Setup

# 1. Create a playlist and populate it with songs that have no cue points.
# 2. Lineup the grid on the tracks if off beat.
# 3. Load the first track.
# 4. Press play in the script editor.
# 5. Enter the number of tracks in the playlist
# 6. ???
# 7. Profit $$$

## The code works by looping over the - increment beat right -- button a number of times. You can change this to jump any amount, just change the number of loops accordingly.
## Will set a memory and hot cue at the designated locations.
